# TodoTasks
All current tasks for this project will be documented in this file.

High priority tasks are written using **bold** font, regular with no formatting and low priority - with *italics*. Details of the tasks are written with additional list for that task.

At this moment there's more to create than to improve or build-on so let's change it asap :3

## Current TodoTasks:

### Build-on:


### Improve:
- Make image fit on the screen (no weird cropping)
	- Could be done by forcing crop feature upon meme addition
- Add meme UI
		
- **Users DB**
- Matching
	- Upon right swipe (like on Tinder). Interesting feature could be that in options user can select after how many like he would like to be matched. For example: if someone liked 3 or more memes he is ready to match with someone (and the match will happen if he will meet liked memes requirement of the other user)
- Memes Algorithm
	- Neat idea: The more a meme gets high% of dislikes the lesser chance of it showing up for other users 
	- Show memes only in desired radius from user location
- User Profile UI
	- Options Button
		- Meme Like for Match
		- Change search distance
- Matches UI
- *Detailed Info About the Meme and it's creator upon onClick()*
	- *Look up for other memes by user? Problem is that you couldn't like them and it is kinda weird with <more than one like needed to match> feature.*
	- *Full-screening the meme
- *Chat between Matches*
	- *Just text, no pictures*
- *Moderating module*
	- *Concern: dick pics*

### Done:
- Colors & Icons
- Meme Browsing
- Memes DB
- Login and sign up (also with Facebook)
- Connected to firebase
- Profile UI
- Basic add meme UI
- Data on profile and in top is downloaded from Firebase
